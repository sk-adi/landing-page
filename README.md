# Web Page Creation Project 
This project is a web page created from a provided design as part of a web development assignment. The objective was to replicate a given design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.



## Project Overview - 
**Design Provided:** Two images were given - one showing the complete website layout and another detailing the fonts and colors. -
 **Font Family Used:** The design specified the use of the Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font. 

**Sections:** The website is divided into 4 main sections.
 
 **Responsiveness:** The project is focused on desktop view; mobile optimization will be learned and implemented later.



## Lessons Learned - 
This project helped reinforce the importance of dividing tasks into manageable sections and focusing on one at a time. - I learned the value of attention to detail and the importance of iteration in developmentâ€”building the HTML structure first, then styling, allowed for smoother progress. 

## Future Enhancements - 
**Mobile Responsiveness:** As I continue learning, I plan to revisit this project to make it fully responsive. -

Conclusion
This project was a valuable learning experience, giving me practical exposure to real-world web development tasks. I look forward to applying these skills to more complex projects in the future.
